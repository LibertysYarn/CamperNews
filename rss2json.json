    "description": "\n<p><em>This was originally published on our now-defunct blog on September 17,\u00a02015.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Last week we sent out a short, 3-question survey to all of you who\u2019ve listed Free Code Camp under your education background on LinkedIn. A big thanks to the 400 campers who\u2019ve already responded with valuable feedback, including countless success stories.<br><br>The most important question we asked was, <strong>\u201cWhat could we be doing better?\u201d<\/strong> Here are the five most common suggestions we\u00a0got:<\/p>\n<h4>1. \u201cFree Code Camp should offer me hints in case I get stuck on a challenge.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>For many of our challenges, such as Bonfires, we have a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FreeCodeCamp\/FreeCodeCamp\/wiki\/camperbot\">hint system built into CamperBot in our chat\u00a0rooms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/607\/0*O_iKA7pAKU6JZcFm.png\"><\/figure><p>Since these hints were so widely requested, we\u2019ve started work on a new \u201cHint\u201d button that will provide these hints right inside our challenges.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1009\/0*VkMLm3E4ZgW7-Rgh.png\"><\/figure><h4>2. \u201cFree Code Camp should show me their recommended solution after I complete each challenge.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>There always many ways of solving a given coding challenge. We didn\u2019t want to proscribe a specific approach. However, since this is a popular request, we\u2019ve started work on a feature that will allow you to compare your solution to our solution.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/690\/0*06XRI_ptOr2fS3mm.png\"><\/figure><h4>3.\u201dFree Code Camp should teach me how to use my local development environment.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>For most new coders, configuring a local development environment takes up a lot of time that would be better spent coding. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve designed all of our challenges to be solvable right in your browser.<br><br>Although cloud-based code editors are powerful, you\u2019ll eventually want to get tools like Node.js and MongoDB running on your local computer. So we\u2019re working on a variety of wiki articles that will walk you through configuring your local development environment on various operating systems.<\/p>\n<h4>4. \u201cFree Code Camp should work better on my\u00a0phone.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>One thing that was clear from our feedback was that campers commute a lot, and want to work through our challenges on their phones and tablets.<br><br>We designed Free Code Camp to work this way, but recently a bug cropped up that prevented challenge submission. We dove in and isolated the cause of this bug, then fixed it.<br><br>You can once again complete our challenges on your phone or tablet. This said, we still recommend coding on a laptop or desktop when possible.<\/p>\n<h4>5. \u201cFree Code Camp should work in\u00a0China.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>Many campers reported that Free Code Camp had stopped working inside China. This was due to the Chinese government\u2019s Great Firewall, which blocks not only Google, but also its CDNs and other useful resources like Google Fonts.<br><br>We\u2019ve removed all of Google\u2019s CDNs and are serving Google Fonts ourselves to ensure that Free Code Camp loads properly in\u00a0China.<\/p>\n<h3>We also had some common requests that we don\u2019t plan to address in the near\u00a0future.<\/h3>\n<h4>1. \u201cFree Code Camp should offer mentorship.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, put it\u00a0best:<\/p>\n<blockquote><em>\u201cI meet a lot of young people who waste a lot of time worrying about finding a magical mentor who will help them to greatness. But greatness will only come from within you. Yes, you need to learn from others, but seek wisdom from\u00a0many.\u201d<\/em><\/blockquote>\n<p>Just as it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a community of helpful friends to elevate a coder to greatness.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/960\/0*CN4dxErIO-qPl6l8.jpg\"><\/figure><p>Instead of seeking mentorship, We encourage you to take Jimmy Wales\u2019 advice to heart and make the most of your local Campsites, hackerspaces, and coding\u00a0meetups.<\/p>\n<h4>2. \u201cFree Code Camp should have reviews of other resources, such as books or\u00a0tools.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>We choose to spend our time making Free Code Camp better for you\u200a\u2014\u200anot writing reviews of ways other resources could be better.<br><br>We do frequently recommend resources on <a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\/freecodecamp\">Facebook<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/user?screen_name=freecodecamp\">Twitter<\/a>, when we are confident they\u2019re worth your time.<br><br>For starters, <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.freecodecamp.com\/2015\/06\/25-free-resources-for-new-javascript-developers.html\">here\u2019s a list of 25 free resources for new developers<\/a> put together by our community.<\/p>\n<h3>Many campers also pointed out issues that we\u2019ve already solved, and apparently haven\u2019t done a good job of announcing.<\/h3>\n<h4>1. \u201cNavigating to my next challenge using the challenge map was a pain. There must be a better\u00a0way.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>We recently added a \u201cLearn\u201d button to our navigation bar. Now you can click \u201cLearn\u201d and immediately go to whichever challenge you were working on\u00a0last.<\/p>\n<h4>2. \u201cI should be able to skip challenges that cover technologies that I\u2019m already familiar\u00a0with.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>We want to take this opportunity to point out that you can actually skip our Waypoints entirely if you\u00a0want.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*jObHU_NX5jnZ3bvx.jpg\"><\/figure><p>That\u2019s right\u200a\u2014\u200aneither our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FreeCodeCamp\/FreeCodeCamp\/wiki\/Free-Code-Camp-Front-End-Development-Certificate\">Front End Development Certificate<\/a>, nor our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FreeCodeCamp\/FreeCodeCamp\/wiki\/Free-Code-Camp-Full-Stack-Development-Certificate\">Full Stack Development Certificate<\/a>, require completion of our Waypoints. If you know what you\u2019re doing, feel free to dive straight into our Bonfires, Ziplines and Basejumps. We think you\u2019ll agree that these projects are where a majority of the learning takes\u00a0place.<\/p>\n<h4>If you haven\u2019t added Free Code Camp to your LinkedIn education background, it only takes 30\u00a0seconds.<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/profile\/edit-education?school=Free+Code+Camp\">Follow this link<\/a>, then set your graduation date as next year. For \u201cDegree\u201d, type \u201cFull Stack Web Development\u201d. For \u201cField of study\u201d, type \u201cComputer Software Engineering\u201d.

This was due to the Chinese government\u2019s Great Firewall, which blocks not only Google, but also its CDNs and other useful resources like Google Fonts.<br><br>We\u2019ve removed all of Google\u2019s CDNs and are serving Google Fonts ourselves to ensure that Free Code Camp loads properly in\u00a0China.<\/p>\n<h3>We also had some common requests that we don\u2019t plan to address in the near\u00a0future.<\/h3>\n<h4>1. \u201cFree Code Camp should offer mentorship.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, put it\u00a0best:<\/p>\n<blockquote><em>\u201cI meet a lot of young people who waste a lot of time worrying about finding a magical mentor who will help them to greatness. But greatness will only come from within you. Yes, you need to learn from others, but seek wisdom from\u00a0many.\u201d<\/em><\/blockquote>\n<p>Just as it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a community of helpful friends to elevate a coder to greatness.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/960\/0*CN4dxErIO-qPl6l8.jpg\"><\/figure><p>Instead of seeking mentorship, We encourage you to take Jimmy Wales\u2019 advice to heart and make the most of your local Campsites, hackerspaces, and coding\u00a0meetups.<\/p>\n<h4>2. \u201cFree Code Camp should have reviews of other resources, such as books or\u00a0tools.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>We choose to spend our time making Free Code Camp better for you\u200a\u2014\u200anot writing reviews of ways other resources could be better.<br><br>We do frequently recommend resources on <a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\/freecodecamp\">Facebook<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/user?screen_name=freecodecamp\">Twitter<\/a>, when we are confident they\u2019re worth your time.<br><br>For starters, <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.freecodecamp.com\/2015\/06\/25-free-resources-for-new-javascript-developers.html\">here\u2019s a list of 25 free resources for new developers<\/a> put together by our community.<\/p>\n<h3>Many campers also pointed out issues that we\u2019ve already solved, and apparently haven\u2019t done a good job of announcing.<\/h3>\n<h4>1. \u201cNavigating to my next challenge using the challenge map was a pain. There must be a better\u00a0way.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>We recently added a \u201cLearn\u201d button to our navigation bar. Now you can click \u201cLearn\u201d and immediately go to whichever challenge you were working on\u00a0last.<\/p>\n<h4>2. \u201cI should be able to skip challenges that cover technologies that I\u2019m already familiar\u00a0with.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>We want to take this opportunity to point out that you can actually skip our Waypoints entirely if you\u00a0want.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/0*jObHU_NX5jnZ3bvx.jpg\"><\/figure><p>That\u2019s right\u200a\u2014\u200aneither our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FreeCodeCamp\/FreeCodeCamp\/wiki\/Free-Code-Camp-Front-End-Development-Certificate\">Front End Development Certificate<\/a>, nor our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FreeCodeCamp\/FreeCodeCamp\/wiki\/Free-Code-Camp-Full-Stack-Development-Certificate\">Full Stack Development Certificate<\/a>, require completion of our Waypoints. If you know what you\u2019re doing, feel free to dive straight into our Bonfires, Ziplines and Basejumps. We think you\u2019ll agree that these projects are where a majority of the learning takes\u00a0place.<\/p>\n<h4>If you haven\u2019t added Free Code Camp to your LinkedIn education background, it only takes 30\u00a0seconds.<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/profile\/edit-education?school=Free+Code+Camp\">Follow this link<\/a>, then set your graduation date as next year. For \u201cDegree\u201d, type \u201cFull Stack Web Development\u201d. For \u201cField of study\u201d, type \u201cComputer Software Engineering\u201d.
